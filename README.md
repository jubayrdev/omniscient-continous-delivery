## Omniscient Continous Delivery

##### Background

This is a continous delivery application for nodejs projects. There may be existing ci/cd tools that will let me do the task easily. But I am a developer, not a devops. I don't know much about how these devops tools works. I want something very simple.

I want to edit the code, make a push on github. Github can take care of the testing. After the testing is done, I want it to deploy my code to virtual machine.

#### Idea

Omniscient Client will be running on the virtual machine, we will be able to set the client as master/slave.
